Here is our blog. Check out our first post below to learn more about eco-anxiety. On any page that contains blog posts it is important to include a "listing" category in the page's yml.

For this page, the yml looks like this:

```{r}
# listing:
#  contents: posts
#  fields: [image, date, title, author, description]
#  sort: "date desc"
#  type: grid
```
